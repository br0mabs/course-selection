ok so what is the important information?

for exams (TST), we just need the day of the week + the time of the exam, which we get from clasMeetingWeekPatternCode and classMeetingStartTime and classMeetingEndTime

so we just need this information for now

but to display it to the user should we have more information?

well we don't need to display exam time
tutorial time is the same as lecture time
lab time is the same too

important information:
- classNumber
- courseComponent
- scheduleData -> classMeetingDayPatternCode --> R means thursday for some reason, just make sure to do that when printing
- scheduleData -> classMeetingWeekPatternCode
- scheduleData -> classMeetingStartTime
- scheduleData -> classMeetingEndTime

so we just parse it into these things, and then we associate it with a data object

so we need to define new classes of objects containing this information, which we are fetching from the api

so the flow will go like:


user enters the term, and list of courses, which will just be a list which they can add input to, and then this will save the input to a list of courses
we then take the list of courses, we will run api call for that term, and get the schedules
we will then parse the json into data objects, and then run the logic, which will just go through all to all pair matching (how do we implement this?)
also we are considering "normal" courses, so like no engineers because they probably don't need this anyways

so that means we need to do a check for lec, do a check for tut, do a check for lab, etc.

so basically we need the courseComponent, we get all distinct courseComponent, and then we have to make sure we have one of each

so this could get big pretty fast?

like lets say 5 classes, lec lab for both

then 10 possibilities

for first year classes this could take a while, but lets say like 3 lec and 3 lab slots for each

then 3^10 is not bad, can run, and also we can have early stopping, maybe using recursion or something

we can use recursion, go through the courses we do need to select, and then with the indexing, we are able to recover possible output

recursion might stack overflow though, is there an iterative method?

lets just say recursion for now.

that works, we just need the selected objects and return the information based on that

and then computing conflict is different --> for tst we don't output but we need to check for conflict
